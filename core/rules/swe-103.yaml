    message: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags
      that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
      ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
      an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the
      contract system negatively.
